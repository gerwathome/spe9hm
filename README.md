# spe9hm
This work is to create a synthetic history match problem using the [Ninth SPE Comparative Solution Project](http://www.ipt.ntnu.no/~kleppe/pub/SPE-COMPARATIVE/papers/ninth.pdf)  .  This hm problem is to be used as an example for the [runOPM](https://github.com/gerwathome/runOPM)   R package.  During preparation of the data, I became aware of some issues surrounding the construction of an [OPM](http://opm-project.org/)
***flow*** model using block centered geometry.  This is discussed somewhat [here](https://gerwathome.github.io/spe9hm) .
